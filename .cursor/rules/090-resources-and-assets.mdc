# Assets

- Prefer Material icons and vector drawables; prefix custom assets consistently.

# Strings

- Keep `strings.xml` organized; no hard-coded user-facing strings in code.

# Configuration

- Do not commit secrets. Use environment-specific configuration; document values during implementation (rule only).
