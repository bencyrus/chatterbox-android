# Navigation

- Use Navigation Compose with type-safe destinations (sealed route objects or enums).
- Centralize route definitions in the composition root; views trigger navigation via ViewModel intents.

# App Links

- Implement Intent handling; map `Uri` to typed routes.
- Validate and sanitize deep link inputs; ignore malformed or unsafe routes.

# Back Behavior

- Preserve user expectations for back navigation; do not pop on background operations.
