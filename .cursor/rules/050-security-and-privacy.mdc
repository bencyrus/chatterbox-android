# Data Protection

- Store tokens/keys using AndroidX Security Crypto (EncryptedSharedPreferences).
- Use Tink-backed defaults; do not implement custom crypto.

# Permissions

- Request microphone permission just-in-time with clear rationale (future recording feature).
- Include required manifest usage descriptions.

# PII & Logging

- No PII or secrets in logs. Use `Log` sparingly with redaction.

# Threat Awareness

- For sensitive features, consider threat models during implementation (rules only).
