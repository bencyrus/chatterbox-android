# Unit Tests

- Test ViewModels, Use Cases, Repositories; mock network with fakes.
- Deterministic tests only; no real network.

# UI Tests

- Cover onboarding, magic login, recording, playback, and logout flows (future recording).
- Use accessibility semantics for selectors.

# Coverage & Regression

- Maintain meaningful coverage on core logic.
- Add tests for any fixed bug.
